Upload the provided CSV file to your designated Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. This transactional data represents a sample of real-world cases from the online food delivery industry. It includes information such as customer ID, date, time, order ID, items ordered, transaction amount, payment mode, restaurant name, order status, customer ratings, and feedback. The data showcases various scenarios, including late delivery, stale food, and complicated ordering procedures, providing valuable insights into different aspects of the customer experience.

# <img width="40" alt="image" src="https://beam.apache.org/images/mascot/beam_mascot_500x500.png"> Beam code

üìñ

`beam.py` code is a data processing pipeline implemented using Apache Beam. It reads data from an input file, performs cleaning and filtering operations, and writes the results to two separate BigQuery tables based on specific conditions.

The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. Command-line arguments are parsed to specify the input file.
2. The data is read from the input file and undergoes cleaning operations, such as removing trailing colons and special characters.
3. The cleaned data is split into two branches based on the status of the orders: delivered and undelivered.
4. The total count of records, delivered orders count, and undelivered orders count are computed and printed.
5. The cleaned and filtered data from the delivered orders branch is transformed into JSON format and written to a BigQuery table.
6. Similarly, the cleaned and filtered data from the undelivered orders branch is transformed into JSON format and written to another BigQuery table.
7. The pipeline is executed, and the success or failure status is printed.

üë©‚Äçüíª

Set the project in the cloud shell: `gcloud config set project your-project-id`

Install Apache Beam in the cloud shell: `pip install apache-beam[gcp]`

Give the Beam code a test run in the shell and then check the results in BigQuery:  `python beam.py --input gs://your-bucket/food_daily.csv --temp_location gs://your-bucket`

‚ùó  Make sure that all your files and services are in the same location. E.g. both buckets should be in the same location or you will get a similar error message: 'Cannot read and write in different locations: source: US, destination: EU‚Äô

üìñ

The DAG monitors the GCS bucket for new files with the specified prefix using the GoogleCloudStoragePrefixSensor (for Airflow 1) or GCSObjectsWithPrefixExistenceSensor (for Airflow 2). When a new file is found, it executes the `list_files` function which uses the GoogleCloudStorageHook (for Airflow 1) and GCSHook (for Airflow 2) to move the file to a 'processed' subdirectory and delete the original file. Finally, it triggers the execution of a Dataflow pipeline using the DataFlowPythonOperator (for Airflow 1) or DataflowCreatePythonJobOperator/BeamRunPythonPipelineOperator (for Airflow 2) with the processed file as input.

This setup is ideal for recurring data processing workflows where files arrive in a GCS bucket at regular intervals (e.g., every 10 minutes) and need to be transformed using Dataflow and loaded into BigQuery. By using Apache Airflow and this DAG, you can automate and schedule the data processing workflow. The DAG ensures that the tasks are executed in the defined order and at the specified intervals.

Do note that the actual operator and hook names, and some of their parameters, will differ between Airflow 1 and Airflow 2. Be sure to use the correct names and parameters for your version of Airflow. For example, if your code contains `contrib` imports, it can only be run in Composer 1. 

For more information about Airflow operators, please refer to the official Apache Airflow documentation at https://airflow.apache.org/ or the Astronomer Registry at https://registry.astronomer.io/. Additionally, if you have any specific questions or need further guidance, you can interact with "Ask Astro" an LLM-powered chatbot, available at https://ask.astronomer.io.

Enable Cloud Composer API, Dataflow API: `gcloud services enable composer.googleapis.com dataflow.googleapis.com`

## üå†Composer 1 

[DataFlowPythonOperator](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/1.10.5/_api/airflow/contrib/operators/dataflow_operator/index.html#airflow.contrib.operators.dataflow_operator.DataFlowPythonOperator) can be used to launch Dataflow jobs written in Python.

To proceed, create a Composer 1 environment.

![image](https://github.com/janaom/gcp-data-engineering-etl-with-composer-dataflow/assets/83917694/f5f7d40b-67fe-4206-9501-92b042c950f7)


 - Select n1-standard-1 (1 vCPU, 3.75 GB RAM)

 - Disk size: 30. The disk size in GB used for node VMs. Minimum is 30 GB. If unspecified, defaults to 100 GB. Cannot be updated. 

 - The Google Cloud Platform Service Account to be used by the node VMs. If a service account is not specified, the "default" Compute Engine service account is used. Cannot be updated.

Creating a Composer 1 environment typically takes around 15 minutes. If the creation process fails, you may want to consider trying a different zone.

![image](https://github.com/janaom/gcp-data-engineering-etl-with-composer-dataflow/assets/83917694/a9bb70e4-0cef-4290-ba6a-c81e587046f9)

The same `beam.py`, tested in the shell, can be used for both Composer 1 and Composer 2. 

Upload the `beam.py` code to the Composer bucket.

Upload `airflow.py` file to the dags folder.

![image](https://github.com/janaom/gcp-data-engineering-etl-with-composer-dataflow/assets/83917694/91ef65c4-37de-42b4-85be-85187a4db78c)

After a few minutes, the DAG will appear in the Airflow UI. For testing purposes, the DAG is initially scheduled to run every 10 minutes. However, you have the flexibility to modify the schedule according to your specific requirements. Wait for the scheduled run to occur automatically or manually trigger the DAG.

## üå†Composer 2

Let's move to Composer 2. Create a Composer 2 environment. 

The DAGs feature two operators: [DataflowCreatePythonJobOperator](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-google/stable/_api/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/dataflow/index.html#airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.dataflow.DataflowCreatePythonJobOperator) and [BeamRunPythonPipelineOperator](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-apache-beam/stable/operators.html#python-pipelines-with-dataflowrunner). While the former is deprecated and no longer actively maintained, it is still available and functional. Although it is recommended to use the Beam operator for improved functionality and ongoing support, you can still try the deprecated operator.


![image](https://github.com/janaom/gcp-data-engineering-etl-with-composer-dataflow/assets/83917694/9d918734-cd98-49eb-a973-586d6178d341)


‚ùó It's important to give `Cloud Composer v2 API Service Agent Extension` role to your Service Account.

Select Environment size: Small.

Since it is scheduled to run '@daily' this time, I manually triggered it.

![image](https://github.com/janaom/gcp-data-engineering-etl-with-composer-dataflow/assets/83917694/4b889475-d7ab-4c62-81eb-97f153b2bb91)

Open Dataflow to check if the job is currently running.
